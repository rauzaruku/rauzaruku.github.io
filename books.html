    <h2>Bookshelf</h2>
    <p> i love reading books and looking for books on personal websites, twitter profiles, and very rarely goodreads too.this is a collected bookshelf of all my readings in no specific order. someday in the future, we will have a library as vast as the imperial library of trantor and everyone would be able to access every book they need and no great book will be lost. i would love to see a Galactic Press as i am not quite supportive of the Fahreheit 251 future.</p>
